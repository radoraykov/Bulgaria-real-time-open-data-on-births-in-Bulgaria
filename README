This code downloads real time data from a government website containing live reports on birth rates in each region in Bulgaria. This data contains only numbers and no private information. The reports are submitted within three days of the actual births. While the original website has a map and date picker, it is not good enough. This project aims at opening this data and visualizing it in a better way. It also mashes it up with census data allowing calculation of birth rates relative to the number of people of certain age in any region.
